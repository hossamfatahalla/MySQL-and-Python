# MySQL and Python DevOps Project

## Overview
This project is a web application that allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage a personal bucket list. It integrates **MySQL** for data storage and **Python** for backend processing, while leveraging **Docker**, **Terraform**, and **Jenkins** for a complete DevOps workflow, including infrastructure provisioning and CI/CD automation.

## Features
- User registration and login functionality
- Bucket list management
- MySQL database integration
- Docker containerization
- Terraform for infrastructure automation
- Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:
- **Python 3.x**
- **MySQL**
- **Docker**
- **Terraform**
- **Jenkins**

## Setup Guide

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hossamfatahalla/MySQL-and-Python.git
cd MySQL-and-Python
```

### 2. Database Setup:
1. Make sure MySQL is installed and running.
2. Create a new MySQL database and update the connection settings in `config.py`.

```python
DB_HOST = 'localhost'
DB_USER = 'root'
DB_PASSWORD = 'your_password'
DB_NAME = 'bucketlist_db'
```

3. Run the database migrations:
```bash
python manage.py db init
python manage.py db migrate
python manage.py db upgrade
```

### 3. Run the Application:
```bash
python app.py
```
The app should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 4. Docker Setup:
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t bucketlist-app .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 bucketlist-app
   ```

### 5. Terraform Setup:
1. Navigate to the Terraform directory:
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. Apply the Terraform configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

### 6. Jenkins Setup:
1. Install Jenkins and configure the pipeline using the provided `Jenkinsfile`.
2. Ensure that Docker and Terraform are properly integrated within the Jenkins environment.
3. Set up webhook triggers for automated CI/CD when changes are pushed to the repository.

## CI/CD Pipeline
This project is configured with Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment process. When changes are pushed to the GitHub repository, Jenkins pulls the latest code, builds the Docker container, and applies the Terraform configuration to deploy the infrastructure.

## Usage
- **User Registration**: Create an account and log in to start creating your bucket list.
- **Manage Bucket List**: Add, view, update, and delete items on your personal bucket list.
